# Review of Discussed Features

I have carefully reviewed the current state of the codebase against all our previously discussed requirements. 

Here is the status of everything:

### ✅ Successfully Implemented & Working
1. **Heatmap Updates:** Submissions are now grouped clearly by month with custom tooltips (e.g., "1 submission on December 17th").
2. **Dashboard Edit Profile Dialog:** The intrusive browser prompt was successfully replaced by a custom dropdown dialog for Username and Email.
3. **Profile Photo Upload:** Selecting a profile photo properly opens your local file browser instead of a URL prompt.
4. **Home Page & Icons:** Redundant emojis/images were removed, and the "About BiteCode" section was added cleanly.
5. **Problem List Status "Radio Buttons":** The list displays sleek radio-button-style SVGs (Empty circle for unsolved, Green check circle for solved, Red cross for wrong).
6. **Toast Notifications:** The app drops down a pastel-colored Toast for Accepted (Green) and Wrong Answer (Red).
7. **Wishlist Duplication Bug:** Clicking the `⋮` dots no longer forces the problem into a default "Wishlist" collection automatically.
8. **Wishlist Backend:** The missing `/items` SQL route and the database constraint errors have been patched completely in your local backend codebase. *(Note: you will still need to deploy this to Render to see it work live!)*

### ⚠️ Overwritten/Missing Code (Requires your attention)
I noticed that your most recent manual save to `frontend/js/problem.js` (where you added the multi-testcase loop `runCode`) accidentally reverted some of the UI fixes we made earlier. 

Specifically, these 4 things are currently broken or missing due to the file overwrite:

1. **Console Toggle Bug:** The "Console" button will currently hide the **Run and Submit** buttons because it toggles the entire wrapper instead of just the inner body.
2. **Submit Output Formatting:** We previously made it so submitting code produced a beautiful, styled visual report of your Runtime and Language. Your recent overwrite deleted this; currently, hitting "Submit" shows **nothing** in the console pane.
3. **Submissions History UI:** The history log of your past submissions reverted to a plain, unstyled text list layout (e.g., `accepted | python`).
4. **Difficulty Badge:** The logic that dynamically colored the "Easy/Medium/Hard" tags at the top of the problem pane got erased.

Would you like me to quickly restore exactly those 4 missing UI features into your newly updated `problem.js` script so everything looks perfect?
